# Triage Labels

The skills speak in terms of five canonical triage roles. This file maps those roles to the actual label strings used in this repo's issue tracker.

| Label in mattpocock/skills | Label in our tracker | Meaning                                  |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `needs-triage`             | `needs-triage`       | Maintainer needs to evaluate this issue  |
| `needs-info`               | `needs-info`         | Waiting on reporter for more information |
| `ready-for-agent`          | `ready-for-agent`    | Fully specified, ready for an AFK agent  |
| `ready-for-human`          | `ready-for-human`    | Requires human implementation            |
| `wontfix`                  | `wontfix`            | Will not be actioned                     |

When a skill mentions a role (e.g. "apply the AFK-ready triage label"), use the corresponding label string from this table.

## Mandatory label set

This repo's deck uses a mandatory label set alongside the triage roles. These three labels must exist, and every new issue carries at least one of them:

- `bug` — something is broken (drives the fix action / BUG filter)
- `needs-triage` — unexamined issue awaiting diagnosis (drives the diagnose action / TRIAGE filter; this is also the canonical `needs-triage` role above)
- `wayfinder:grilling` — an open decision/discussion ticket (drives the discuss action; wayfinder's `grilling` ticket type)

## Wayfinder label set

The `/wayfinder` skill requires all five wayfinder labels to exist. Every wayfinder child ticket carries exactly one of them:

- `wayfinder:map` — the parent map issue (Notes / Decisions-so-far / Fog)
- `wayfinder:research` — research ticket
- `wayfinder:prototype` — prototype ticket
- `wayfinder:grilling` — grilling/discussion ticket
- `wayfinder:task` — implementation task ticket

Edit the right-hand column to match whatever vocabulary you actually use.
